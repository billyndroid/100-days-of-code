### Day 1: September 09 2021 (Example 1)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: HTML and Styling on tribute page for freecodecamp. Few little elements to complete and will submit, hopefully tomorrow.

**Thoughts:** Will have to try this "Canvas" see if it can help with CSS. But CSS not hard. Maybe when using complicated parallax effects and amations etc.
