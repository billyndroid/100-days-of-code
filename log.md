# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: September 08 2021 

**Today's Progress**: HTML and Styling on tribute page for freecodecamp. Few little elements to complete and will submit, hopefully tomorrow.

**Thoughts:** Will have to try this "Canvas" see if it can help with CSS. But CSS not hard. Maybe when using complicated parallax effects and amations etc.

**Thoughts:** Today I learned the concept of testing as you go â€“ the hard way. A lot of testing and retesting due to leaving testing until the very end. Learned about troubleshooting bugs though , so not wasted. THEN I discovered the button that lists the results of the tests and reason for failure. Doh! 

### Day 3: September 09 2021 

**Today's Progress**: 
JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures @Freecodecamp 25% completed
html and CSS for landing page
Completed Survey Form
**Link to work:**: https://billyndroid.github.io/survey-form/

Thoughts: Landing page wil needs some extra effort styling. Will stick to parameters until met and passed tests and then add some fun styling animations, parallax, icons, etc)
