# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: September 08 2021 

**Today's Progress**: HTML and Styling on tribute page for freecodecamp. Few little elements to complete and will submit, hopefully tomorrow.

**Thoughts:** Will have to try this "Canvas" see if it can help with CSS. But CSS not hard. Maybe when using complicated parallax effects and amations etc.

**Thoughts:** Today I learned the concept of testing as you go â€“ the hard way. A lot of testing and retesting due to leaving testing until the very end. Learned about troubleshooting bugs though , so not wasted. THEN I discovered the button that lists the results of the tests and reason for failure. Doh! 

### Day 3: September 09 2021 

**Today's Progress**: 
JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures @Freecodecamp 25% completed
html and CSS for landing page
Completed Survey Form
**Link to work:**: https://billyndroid.github.io/survey-form/

Thoughts: Landing page wil needs some extra effort styling. Will stick to parameters until met and passed tests and then add some fun styling animations, parallax, icons, etc)

### Day 4: September 10 2021 
**Today's Progress**: Added some styling to a few of the bare projects. 
**Thoughts:** Will need to replace lorem and add a lot more styling, possibly even Bootstrap to the projects so far. Build them into the real-portfolio (link below) and start on next project for FreeCodeCamp JS course. I hope to start contacting people for work soon. I'll make myself known to Prodigi (a local development company that I'd like to work for) asap once feeling confident with JS. I'm going to build a project that utilises their own API and hope to hook employment that way. :D

### Day 5: September 11 2021 

**Today's Progress**: 
Learned a bit more about what can be done with JS and already have began building the basic ideas - EG: drag and drop and crop images.

**Thoughts:** It's really starting to click about what I can do (and not do) with javascript. But that's a good thing. Starting to understand that the huge list of requirements for jobs are not too difficult to obtain once one gets to grips with the basics. 

### Day 6: September 12 2021 

**Today's Progress**: 
Completed Responsive Web Design module at FreeCodeCamp.
**Link to work:**: https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/billythedroid/responsive-web-design

Thoughts: Very happy to have finished and looking forward to the Javascript next. Javascript is already clicking and thoughts of what is next (React) occuring already. Am feeling very positive about this pursuit.

### Day 7: September 13 2021 
**Today's Progress**: 6hrs working on FreeCodeCamp Javascript Algorithms and Data Structures
**Thoughts:** Will do 2hrs learning new CSS everyday and 3hrs on FCC course.

### Day 9: September 15 2021 
**Today's Progress**: Three hours on Javascript course and then some bootstrap/styling for real-portfolio project

### Day 12: September 18 2021 
HTML and CSS updates to real-portfolio. Started new project (building a JS game). Trying out PixiJS and Phaser and set-up web server (XAMPP) to prep. 2 HRS JS at FCC.org
### Day 13: September 19 2021 
**Today's Progress**: 
Read Jquery documentation at w3schools.org
**Thoughts:** 
Some days are just about keeping up/building the habit/discipline. Wasn't feeling it today so did some passive learning. It's good to switch it up anyway, freshens things up.
### Day 14: September 20 2021 
**Today's Progress**: 
added jquery to canvas-game project. some css and html added. 4hrs JS Datastructures and Aglos at FCC
**Thoughts:** 

Struggled a little with switch statements on FCC.org but battled through and finally got it with a bit of googling. Was feeling despondant but had a breakthrough with JQuery and realised that a lot of the long list of skills required on applications and portfolios of others are pretty simple to grasp such as JQuery. Along with reference docs this should be pretty simple to use once I have the just of JS.

### Day 15: September 21 2021 
**Today's Progress**: Reading up on documentation of canvas tag and 2d JS rendering. Added assets to first JS game. 
**Thoughts:**
The learning curve is incredibly high right now but I'm just trying to keep up the habit of coding and hopefully all this will fall into place sometime soon.

### Day 16: September 22 2021 
**Today's Progress**: Almost finished Basic Javascript element of FCC course. Estimate could finish whole course within 2-3 weeks at a push. Did some passive learning more about OOP to try and help this syntax/lines of code make more sense more as a.
**Thoughts:** Waiting for that Eureka moment but persevereing until it happens.
